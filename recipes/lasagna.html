    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach</li>
        <li>3 cooked, boneless chicken breast halves, diced</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo-style pasta sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 pints ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Cook spinach according to package directions; drain.</li>

Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella over chicken mixture. Top with another layer of noodles. Spread spinach mixture evenly over noodles. Pour 1/2 of remaining jar of Alfredo sauce over spinach mixture, spread evenly. Sprinkle another cup of mozzarella over sauce, lay on the final noodle layer and top with remaining 1/2 jar of Alfredo sauce, 2 cups of mozzarella, and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
